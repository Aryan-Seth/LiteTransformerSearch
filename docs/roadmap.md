# Roadmap

We are striving to rapidly update the list of algorithms and encourage pull-requests from the community
of new algorithms.

Here is our current deck:

* [ProxyLess NAS](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.00332)
* [SNAS](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.09926)
* [DATA](http://papers.nips.cc/paper/8374-data-differentiable-architecture-approximation.pdf)
* [RandNAS](https://liamcli.com/assets/pdf/randnas_arxiv.pdf)

Please file in the issues algorithms you would like to see implemented in Archai. We will try our best to accomodate.
